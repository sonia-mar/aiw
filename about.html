                <p>The Ain't I A Woman?! Campaign was started by a group of garment workers fighting DKNY. While wealthy women, such as the founder of DKNY - Donna Karan - were being heralded as icons by the mainstream feminist movement, the garment workers making clothes for DKNY, most of whom were immigrant women of color, were forced to work 70 to 80 hours a week, without overtime and paid less than minimum wage.</p>

            <h2>Code of Conduct - Asking the Fox to Guard the Chicken Coop</h2>
            <p>
                Our “Ain't I a Woman” campaign has been launched amidst a great deal of anti-sweatshop activism. For the most part, unfortunately, sweatshops are framed as a problem of “the other”: far-away workers in Third World countries, immigrant garment workers in this country hidden away behind barbed wires and locked gates.
            </p>
            <p>
                An upsurge of activity has been directed at helping these workers: the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> (United States) Labor Department launched a “No Sweat” campaign to encourage manufacturers to sign on to “voluntary compliance” with labor laws. Students are demanding that their schools contract only with companies that agree to a “code of conduct” - which typically prohibits forced labor, child labor and violations of labor laws - and to “public disclosure” of where and under what conditions their goods are made. Advocacy groups are organizing consumer boycotts of companies exploiting workers abroad, chasing companies like Disney from Haiti to China and promoting the union label.
            </p>
            <p>
                A new form of imperialism has emerged, where U.S. consumers are depicted as the key agents of change and the ones who know what is best for those sweatshop workers who are suffering. Power is seen to reside in your ability to buy things, as a consumer, rather than in your ability to make things or make things run as a worker.
            </p>
            <p>
                This focus on sweatshops overseas actually helps to protect sweatshops in the U.S., diverting attention from the expanding sweatshop system here and driving work from abroad to domestic sweatshops.
            </p>
            <p>
                Voluntary compliance and monitoring measures are also naive. “No Sweat” and Codes of Conducts are based on the premise that corporations are well intentioned. How effective can these measures be if they are asking corporations to voluntarily contradict the very goal of corporations: to make a profit? Moreover, even if independent monitors investigate factories, workers will not tell the truth about sweatshop conditions if they are not organized to face threats of harassment, firing and blacklisting.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, workers from two of the largest sweatshops in Brooklyn, N.Y., were forced to work as long as 137 hours a week producing Street Beat Sportswear for retailers like Sears. Several were fired after asking for a day off. Workers were owed almost $300,000 in unpaid minimum wage and overtime pay and damages. Street Beat had three years earlier signed two compliance agreements with the Department of Labor.
            </p>

            <h2>Women's Work and the Sweatshop Company</h2>
            <p>
                The sweatshop conditions faced by Pactiv factory workers are not so far removed from the experiences of most women workers in this country. Women are disproportionately concentrated in clerical, service-sector and manufacturing jobs. Among all women workers in the U.S., one in five is a cashier, secretary or teacher. Nearly six out of 10 African American women work as nursing attendants, janitors, cleaners, cooks and maids. Immigrant women often take jobs as domestic workers, hotel and restaurant workers, orderlies, nursing assistants and laborers in manufacturing jobs such as garment and meat processing. Unfortunately, these very important areas of work, which we all depend on, tend to be devalued and lower-paid. And regardless of educational levels, in any occupation women are routinely paid less than men doing the same work.
            </p>
            <p>
                And this is just the woman's “official” job. Regardless of race or class, women are still the primary caretakers of children and elderly relatives, and still take on a disproportionate responsibility for housework. This “women's work” is never recognized or valued as work, but is simply expected of women.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding insult to injury, women who have been caring for their children at home and receiving welfare benefits are now being forced into workfare, a government-supported cheap-labor program. These women are working starvation wages doing demeaning and dead-end work, while often having no choice but to pay a babysitter to watch their children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stuck in low-wage jobs and shouldering primary responsibility for their children, many women lack the economic autonomy to escape abusive relationships at home. Those who do are sometimes forced to work several jobs or turn to sex work as a quick way to put food on the table. Nearly a third of all families headed by women are living below the poverty-line. Even well-paid professional women cannot escape hard choices around career and motherhood. For many, advancement means giving all your time, which means having no time for children. Moreover, many bosses fail to offer maternity leave or to guarantee that mothers' jobs will be available when they return.

            <h2>Who benefits the most from subcontracting?</h2>
            <div id="cache-example-intro">
                <h3>The Cache Example: </h3>
                <p>Sub-contracting is a system in which large entities contract out its work to smaller companies or individuals to sweat as much profit out of workers as possible and avoid responsibility for the abuses of these employees. Following is an example of how this works in the garment industry with the Cache garment case.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="row">
                <!-- content created by: https://www.aintiawoman.org/ -->
                <div id="retailer-card" class="card">
                    <h3>Retailer</h3>
                    <p>Apparel manufacturing today is a $10 billion annual business in New York.  For instance, multi-national retailer Cache alone rakes in over $100 million in pure profits each year. Like other retailers, Cache in recent years merged with its manufacturer to consolidate at the top, increasing control over design, distribution and production.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="manufacturer-card" class="card">
                    <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
                    <p>Since 2003, the workers' factory received the majority of work from manufacturer Adrienne Victoria Designs that worked almost exclusively for Cache until 2007, when Cache bought out and merged with Adrienne Victoria Designs.  Manufacturers take orders from designers and retailers, and then contract with factories to produce the clothing.  Through this process, manufacturers inherently promote sweatshop factories that bid the lowest amount, regardless of whether it is enough to pay workers minimum wage in order to produce it.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="factory-card" class="card">
                    <h3>Factory</h3>
                    <p>Through over 13 years, the workers witnessed the factory would often change names in order to evade responsibility for labor violations, thereby preventing the manufacturer from also being held liable.  Nevertheless, Cache routinely sent 'independent' monitors to investigate the conditions in the factory.  Cache even paid workers in checks for violations they found, yet to this day they still do business with the factory.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="workers-card" class="card">
                    <h3>Workers</h3>
                    <p>Workers were paid less than a dollar to sew blouses and dresses with a retail price tag of about $200.  In 2001, the garment manufacturing industry in New York City alone accounted for nearly 100,000 jobs in the fashion industry.[3]  Through the years, due to the lack of accountability in the industry, workers are not even able to survive on such low wages.  As a result, only 24,000 garment workers remain in the New York City apparel manufacturing industry.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="consumers-card" class="card">
                    <h3>Consumers</h3>
                    <p>Typically consumers are seen at the top of the pyramid, as if what we buy or don't buy has the most power. We also think that cheaper labor means cheaper prices for us. But cheaper labor just means greater profit for the manufacturers and retailers. And who are we?  Most people buying sweatshop clothing are also working people.  While we might not work in garment sweatshops, we still do not have control of our time.  Rather than passively boycott as consumers, we must see our power as working people and launch a pro-active campaign to eliminate sweatshops.</p>

                <h3>Demand Stronger Joint Employer Laws</h3>
                <p>In 2001, 26 garment workers filed a federal lawsuit to demand that manufacturer Liberty Apparel be responsible for 80+ hour work weeks at $3 an hour wages.  The long hours not only hurt workers' health, but also took a toll on their families.  Says Liberty worker Hui Ming Dong, “I worked from about 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day. At the time my daughter was 8 years old. The boss considered it a privilege that he allowed me to leave work at 10pm since I had a kid. Most of the other workers usually ended at 11 p.m. or 12 p.m. Because of the long hours, my daughter would have to go to the factory after school. The few times I would take a day off, the boss kept calling and calling to badger me into coming back.  I know that Liberty Apparel was aware we were not getting our wages because all of us would speak to the Liberty Apparel representative about it every day they were there. Liberty Apparel should be held accountable for all the things that went on in the factory.”</p>
                <p>In 2003 the lawsuit was dismissed by a judge that claimed that Liberty Apparel was not a joint employer if it did not have direct control over the workers.  The workers appealed the decision on the basis that Liberty Apparel could have reasonable control and knowledge over work conditions regardless of whether they had direct ownership or control of the factory. They won the appeal, but the case was sent back to the same judge who sat on the case until his death in 2007.  Almost 10 years after the lawsuit was filed, the case finally went to trial before a newly appointed judge.  The jury reached a decision in favor of the workers, determining Liberty Apparel was a joint employer under the Federal Labor Standards Act and New York State labor law, and was therefore responsible for paying the workers their owed wages.  Liberty Apparel appealed the federal court judgment to the U.S. Supreme Court.  In June, 2011, the workers won the U.S. Supreme Court decision.</p>
                <p>The Liberty Apparel workers' long-awaited victory has established a legal precedent for other garment manufacturers to be held accountable, as well as encouraged many other subcontracted workers to speak out against sweatshop abuses.</p>
                <p>Still, an increasing number of companies are adopting the subcontracting model, and as a result, many workers in food service, healthcare and even clerical industries are employed with no job security, social security, healthcare, workers' compensation or unemployment insurance. Yet, the companies on top continue to reap record profits. Sub-contracting particularly affects women, many of whom are still the primary caregivers in the family. As they look for jobs with more flexible work hours, many take temporary and part-time contract jobs that pay low wages with no benefits or job security. And, with Obama's health care bill fining for the failure to provide health insurance only those businesses with 50 or more employees, more businesses will now use subcontracting to avoid having to pay for health insurance.</p>
                <p>The Liberty victory energizes our fight against the subcontracting system. It is a disgrace that Liberty Apparel was able to take advantage of weak laws to drag the case out for so many years. As the economy continues to worsen, more and more workers are under attack. We can't afford to wait. Join the Ain't I A Woman?! Campaign in demanding stronger manufacturer accountability laws. Let's join together to put an end to sweatshop conditions in this country.</p>
