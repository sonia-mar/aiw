                <h2>Justice for Home Care Workers</h2>
                <h4>Work 24 hours; Paid for 13.</h4>

                <p>
                    Right here in New York, home care attendants are paid only 13 hours for a 24 hour workday, during which they are expected to work and take care of patients around the clock. Their take home pay? Less than $7.50/hour.

                    <h4>The “Ain't I a Woman?!” campaign grew from a small group of garment workers who successfully held <abbr>DKNY</abbr> (Donna Karan New York) accountable for sweatshop conditions.</h4>
                </section>
                <p>This became a call for a new women's movement fighting for control over our time, health, respect and wages. DKNY workers have been joined by other workers who also tolerated abusive conditions for the sake of their families — such as the workers of Liberty Apparel's factories, Great Wall, and Cache. Many women are inspired by the example set by these workers who risked so much to fight against longer hours, lower wages and worsening conditions.</p>
                <p>Across industries from corporate law firms to garment factories, control over our time and our lives is slipping away.</p>

                <p>A century after Sojourner Truth's struggles against racism and sexism, women workers are stepping up the fight against the most destructive form that modern-day racism and sexism has taken: economic segregation and the perception that crumbs are better than nothing. Refusing to be treated like slaves or second-class citizens, we are coming together to build upon Sojourner Truth's struggle and proclaiming Ain't I a Woman?!</p>
