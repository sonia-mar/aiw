                <h4>End Forced Overtime - Boycott Reynolds</h4>
                <p>
                    On June 14 of 2012, the <abbr>AIW</abbr> (Ain’t I a Woman?!) Campaign launched a national boycott of Reynolds Group, the parent company of Pactiv. Over 150 working people, their friends, family, and members of the community gathered in front of the Pactiv Corporation plastics factory in Kearny, NJ, to denounce the company’s sweatshop practices, and to announce a national boycott against Reynolds. There to support the launch were many organizations from New Jersey and New York, including American Friends Service Workers Committee, Students Organizing Against Reynolds, United Steel Workers District 4, United Labor Agency of Bergen County <abbr>AFL-CIO</abbr> (American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations), Central Labor Council of Hudson County AFL-CIO, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers AFL-CIO, as well as many more in spirit. Together, we denounced Pactiv for retaliating against women workers standing up for their rights.

                <h4>Assemblymember Ron Kim’s Report</h4>
                <p>
                    In January 2022, New York State Assemblymember Ron Kim’s office published a report detailing <abbr>CPC</abbr> (Chinese-American Planning Council)’s years of breaking labor laws and abusing their immigrant women home care workers.
                    From 2007 to 2010, Ron served as a Regional Director for Government and Community Affairs in the administrations of Governors Eliot Spitzer and David A. Paterson, where he collaborated and worked with a varied group of state agencies, elected officials, and community organizations. After leaving the Governor’s office, he worked as a legislative advocate for children with special needs, small business, and vulnerable New Yorkers. Since his election in 2012, Ron has stood firm in his message of striving to provide quality education for all students, securing funding for local schools, and supporting small businesses in the Flushing community.

                    Between 1979 – 2008, incomes declined by 28.8% after inflation, for low income families and by 13.2% for families in the middle

                    38% of professional men and 23% of middle income men work over 50 hours per week

                    93% of all income gains in 2010 went to the top 1%.

                    Many working parents have to choose between caring for their families and keeping their low-wage jobs.

                    94% of retail managers in one study said they preferred workers who could be available for all hours.

                    Starbucks makes overtime mandatory upwards of 80 hours a week for full time employees.

                    Walmart, the nation’s biggest private employer, forces employees to work all over the clock.

                    In 2001, 26 garment workers filed a federal lawsuit to demand that manufacturer Liberty Apparel be responsible for 80+ hour work weeks at $3 an hour wages.  The long hours not only hurt workers’ health, but also took a toll on their families.  Says Liberty worker Hui Ming Dong, “I worked from about 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day. At the time my daughter was 8 years old. The boss considered it a privilege that he allowed me to leave work at 10pm since I had a kid. Most of the other workers usually ended at 11 p.m. or 12 p.m. Because of the long hours, my daughter would have to go to the factory after school. The few times I would take a day off, the boss kept calling and calling to badger me into coming back.  I know that Liberty Apparel was aware we were not getting our wages because all of us would speak to the Liberty Apparel representative about it every day they were there. Liberty Apparel should be held accountable for all the things that went on in the factory.”
