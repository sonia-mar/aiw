                    Mi nombre es Álvaro Ramírez. Vengo de Santo Domingo. Y trabajé, primero

                    cuando llegué es en el ‘90. Trabajé una factoría, duré 3 años en la factoría.

                    Salí por falta-- no pagaban bien. No pagaban bien, salí, hice el curso de

                    home attendant. Duré dos meses, hice cursos, y busqué trabajo en la

                    agencia, First Chinese. Allí empecé trabajando 24 horas. De las 24 horas

                    acaso pagaban 13. No pagaban las 24 completas. Pasando mucho en la

                    casa del cliente, en la calle, aguantando muchas cosas tanto del paciente

                    como de la familia del paciente. Dicen que se duerme pero no se duerme,

                    mentira. Allí no… 24 no es para dormir no se duerme, porque hay que estar

                    pendiente al paciente, y estar con su medicina y de diferentes horas, y en

                    realidad no se duerme. Entonces estamos tratando de ver ya eso, ese dinero

                    perdido estamos tratando de recuperar. Los chavos que estamos perdidos,

                    las horas que nos quitaron, que nos robaron. De 24 horas, pagando 13. Es

                    mucha la que se quedan con ella. No pagan. Entonces estamos luchando y

                    tratando, aunque no, por ejemplo, me pagan a mí, si otros resuelven, puede

                    uno se conforme.

                    I’ve been a care worker for 6 years, working 24-hour shifts from 2012 to

                    2014. I worked 3 to 5 days a week.

                    My patient Grandma Sun had colon cancer, so the post-surgery care work

                    had to be meticulous. We also had to take care of her husband. At night

                    the two of them would get out of bed at different times, and I had to get

                    up with them to take care of them. Usually at night they would get up 5 or

                    6 times, so I had no way of continuously sleeping more than 2 hours a

                    night.

                    I joined a lawsuit to ask for 24 hours of wages. The judges have already

                    made a decision on some of these cases, that 24-hour workers should get

                    24 hours of wages. But the boss does not act according to the law, and the

                    Department of Labor not only doesn’t help workers, but actually uses

                    emergency regulation to suppress our demands! We went to the union to

                    complain, but to no avail. How is this leaving us women workers with any

                    lifelines?! The system of 24-hour shifts shouldnn't continue! For the health

                    and vitality of workers and patients, splitting into 2 shifts is very necessary.

                    This is the voice of home attendants.

                    I take care of a patient that needs 24-hour care. She pees and

                    poops on her bed. Sometimes the patient can’t poop it out and thus is

                    in pain. I put on plastic gloves to scoop the stool out. Every night, I had

                    to turn over her body 3 times, to lessen her pain.

                    In order to make a living, I’ve neglected my own family to do 24-

                    hour home attendance work. The company told home attendants do

                    not give water to patients at night, do not get up from bed to change

                    their diapers, ignore the patient when they call for help. We can’t do

                    something this inhumane. Eliminate the 24-hour work day system! And

                    compensate all the hours we worked as 24-hrs home attendants. This is

                    our appeal as home attendants!

                    I’ve been a 24-hour care worker for 10 whole years. My patient’s skin was

                    severely scarred after a burn injury, and she had just come back from the

                    hospital. Her ankles had grown ulcers, rotten and torn, and her buttocks were

                    also burned rotten. We home attendants would everyday take care of the

                    patient’s entire body, flipping her over, wiping her down, changing her clothes,

                    washing her hair, changing her diapers and so on. When the weather was nice

                    we would use a hoisting frame to transfer the patient to a wheelchair to go

                    outside and bathe in the sun. At night, the patient would flip around and change

                    diapers, calling out for me at any given moment, at least 3 to 4 times. There was

                    no possible way to get more than 5 hours of continuous sleep.

                    Long-term 24-hour care work made me anxious, nervous, sleep-deprived, with

                    aching limbs and waist, high blood pressure, and stomach disease. You could say

                    that I too become a “patient”. Also, the building where the patient lived hosted a

                    lot of gamblers. Oftentimes at midnight the police would knock on the door to

                    investigate, creating yet another form of pressure and worry.

                    I demand that the government stop the system of 24-hour workdays. Splitting

                    this into 2 shifts is better for the patient and the worker.

                    The patient I took care of was 90 years old, who had very little energy.

                    Walking and going to the toilet, I had to use a lot of energy to support

                    and pull her up, so that she wouldn’t fall down. When night came she

                    would not even sleep, calling for me very often, and wouldn’t let me

                    go to sleep either. If she peed in her clothes, I would also need to help

                    her change. So it was hard, strenuous work. I worked 24 hours a day,

                    head hurting and dizzy the entire day. My shoulders and hands also

                    hurt unbearably.

                    Because my hands hurt, I asked the agency for leave of absence for a

                    period of time. The agency said that if I stopped, my work stopped.

                    Because the company was not giving me work, my home attendant

                    license was discontinued, and to this day I still haven’t found any

                    work. I must rely on my child to live and support me.

                    Lai Yee Chan, a home attendant for the <abbr>CPC</abbr> (Chinese-American Planning Council), helped her patients day and night for over 15 years. During the day, she bathed and fed her patients. At night, she helped them get out of bed and go to the bathroom or get a drink of water. She could not leave her patient for even a second of her 24-hour shift. One day her daughter was locked out of her house, but Lai Yee was not allowed to go downstairs to give her daughter the key. Adding insult to injury, Lai Yee has not seen a pay increase in 8 years, is not paid for the 12 hours of work at night, except for a small fee, and is never paid overtime. Ultimately, workers like Lai Yee are paid about $5/hour, way less than the minimum wage.
