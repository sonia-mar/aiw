# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - Submitting milestones on time
    - Having good quality work
    - Communicating with one another
    - Adhering to our individual responsibilities

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - Being respectful of other memebers
    - Attending scheduled meetings
    - Contributing to best of our ability

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We will communicate via text in our groupchat on a regular basis, and we will meet weekly on Tuesday from 12-2pm.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

   We will communicate with our client via email on a more regular day-to-day basis to ask about any small/quick questions that come up  as we design their. We will also set up weekly zoom calls which will be beneficial for initial planning, adressing major concerns, and discussing our progress.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    Everyone will be part of the designing and coding process
    Sonia: leading communication with the client
    Huanran: Will be responsible for ensuring that the html is structured properly and helping fix any issues with the coding part
    Neha: Will be ensuring that the CSS is consistent across pages, and helping other members with design process
    Andy: Checking for mistakes, encouraging communication within the team, and making sure the project is on track with time.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    We will hold ourselves accountable by adhering to the deadlines we create and also sending regular updates about our progress. If a group member is not delivering we will first ask them why they are unable to deliver, then offer to help them and come up with possible solutions. If they still do not deliver, we can possibly go to the instructors.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    We are committed to fostering effective communication among our team members. Whether it pertains to design, color themes, or content, we aim to thoroughly investigate the root causes of any issues and actively seek viable solutions. In cases where a resolution proves elusive, we will initiate a formal voting process.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    If there is an issue involving responsibilities and communication that we are unable to resolve, or if we all agree that something about our working progress should be changed, we will revisit this contracts and make edits. Any edits that we make should be agreed upon by everyone in the group.


9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    We can all get dessert after we complete the project!

    We should all be kind, compassionate, and willing helping to help one another.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
